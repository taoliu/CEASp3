** Requirements **

1. CEAS was developed based on Python 2.5.1; thus, Python higher than 2.5.1 is recommended to be installed for running CEAS w/o any potential version mismatch problems.
2. MySQLdb Python package is optional; however, if users want to directly use gene annotation tables from UCSC, MySQL and MySQLdb must be installed before installing CEAS.


** Installation Steps **

Unix-like OS (UNIX, Linux, or Mac OS X):

1. Extract CEAS-X.X.X.tar.gz by typing on the command line;

      $ tar xvf CEAS-X.X.X.tar.gz

2. Enter the folder created by tar (i.e. ./CEAS-X.X.X) and type the following on the command line.

      $ cd CEAS-X.X.X

      $ sudo python setup.py install

Note that the installer must have the proper security privilege to install CEAS at /usr/local/bin; otherwise, the user can install CEAS at the home as follows.

      $ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

where $HOME stands for the user's home. Then, add a line to the log-in shell script (i.e. .bashrc in case of bash shell)

      export $PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/lib/python2.5/site-packages

where 'python2.5' should be changed to the Python version that the user uses.
